# ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl


[Probability bounds analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_bounds_analysis) in Julia, a package for performing arithmetic between uncertain numbers. `ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl` computes guaranteed bounds on functions of random variables, given only partial information about their marginals and dependence. Considered to be a form of rigorous computing with random variables.


Supported uncertain numbers: 

  * scalars
  * [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function)
  * [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic)
  * [probability boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_box) (p-boxes)

Installation
---
Two ways to install and use:

**1. From the julia package manager**

You may download the lastest release by:
```julia
julia> ]
(v1.0) pkg> add ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis
julia> using ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis
```

or the latest version by:

```julia
julia> ]
(v1.0) pkg> add ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis#master
julia> using ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis
```

or

```julia
julia> ]
(v1.0) pkg> add https://github.com/AnderGray/ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl.git
julia> using ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis
```

**2. Downloading the source code**
```julia
git clone https://github.com/AnderGray/ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl.git

julia> include("ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl/src/ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl")
julia> using Main.ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis
```

For plotting
---

[PyPlot.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl) is used for all of the plotting functionality, it is however not installed by default. If you wish to plot p-boxes, you will need to install and the specifically call `PyPlot`.

**To install**
```julia
julia> ]
(v1.0) pkg> add PyPlot
```

`Matplotlib` needs to be installed on your computer. If it is not, it can be installed by

```julia
julia -e 'ENV["PYTHON"]=""; using Pkg; Pkg.add("Conda"); using Conda; Conda.add("matplotlib"); Pkg.add("PyCall"); Pkg.build("PyCall"); Pkg.add("PyPlot");'
```
**To use**

```julia
julia> using ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis, PyPlot
julia> a = normal(0,1)
julia> plot(a)
```
