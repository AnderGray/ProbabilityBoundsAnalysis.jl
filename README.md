[Probability bounds analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_bounds_analysis) in Julia, a package for performing arithmetic between uncertain numbers. `ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl` computes guaranteed bounds on functions of random variables, given only partial information about their marginals and dependence. Considered to be a form of rigorous computing with random variables.

<!---
This software began as a port from [pba.r](https://github.com/ScottFerson/pba.r) by Scott Ferson and Jason O'Rawe, Applied Biomathematics (2006)
--->

Supported uncertain numbers: 

  * scalars
  * [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function)
  * [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic)
  * [probability boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_box) (p-boxes)

For more information and use, please see the [docs](https://andergray.github.io/ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl/dev/)
