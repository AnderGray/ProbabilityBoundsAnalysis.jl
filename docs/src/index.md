# ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl


[Probability bounds analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_bounds_analysis) in Julia, a package for performing arithmetic between uncertain numbers. `ProbabilityBoundsAnalysis.jl` computes guaranteed bounds on functions of random variables, given only partial information about their marginals and dependence. Considered to be a form of rigorous computing with random variables.


Supported uncertain numbers: 

  * scalars
  * [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function)
  * [intervals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic)
  * [probability boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_box) (p-boxes)
