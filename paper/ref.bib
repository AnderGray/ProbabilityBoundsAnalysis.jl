    abstract = { Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: \beginlist \item High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. \item One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. \item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. \endlist We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience. }

Some basic properties of such systems are explored in Sects. 1 and 2. Other approaches to upper and lower probabilities are possible and some of these are related to the present approach in Sect. 3. A distinctive feature of the present approach is a rule for conditioning, or more generally, a rule for combining sources of information, as discussed in Sects. 4 and 5. Finally, the context in statistical inference from which the present theory arose is sketched briefly in Sect. 6.",

  author = {L.A Zadeh},
  abstract = {The theory of possibility described in this paper is related to the theory of fuzzy sets by defining the concept of a possibility distribution as a fuzzy restriction which acts as an elastic constraint on the values that may be assigned to a variable. More specifically, if F is a fuzzy subset of a universe of discourse U = {u} which is characterized by its membership function μF, then a proposition of the form “X is F”, where X is a variable taking values in U, induces a possibility distribution t̊x which equates the possibility of X taking the value u to μF(u)—the compatibility of u with F. In this way, X becomes a fuzzy variable which is associated with the possibility distribution t̊x in much the same way as a random variable is associated with a probability distribution. In general, a variable may be associated both with a possibility distribution and a probability distribution, with the weak connection between the two expressed as the possibility/probability consistency principle. A thesis advanced in this paper is that the imprecision that is intrinsic in natural languages is, in the main, possibilistic rather than probabilistic in nature. Thus, by employing the concept of a possibility distribution, a proposition, p, in a natural language may be translated into a procedure which computes the probability distribution of a set of attributes which are implied by p. Several types of conditional translation rules are discussed and, in particular, a translation rule for propositions of the form “X is F is α-possible”, where α is a number in the interval [0,1], is formulated and illustrated by examples.}

  abstract = {This contribution is intended to promote possibility theory as a maturing general framework for the quantification of epistemic and aleatory uncertainties. For this purpose, we revisit Zadeh’s Extension Principle in the context of imprecise probabilities. Therein the aggregation of the possibility distributions is performed by the minimum-operator, corresponding to non-interactivity of the uncertain variables. Yet, this notion is not equivalent to well-established terms from probability theory such as stochastic independence. In order to use possibilistic calculus for propagating multivariate imprecise probabilities through models, we present suitable aggregation operations, corresponding to simple modifications of the Extension Principle, and we prove preservation of probability-possibility consistency, the fundamental concept in possibility theory. For the purpose of demonstration, the possibilistic solutions of two benchmark problems of uncertainty quantification are presented.}

Similarly, we can consider a set of copulas instead of a single one. We study the extension of Sklar's theorem under these conditions, and link the obtained results to stochastic ordering with imprecision.}
